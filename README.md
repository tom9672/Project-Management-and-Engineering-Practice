## What are the stages of group development?
1. ***Forming*** - Everyone comes together first time. (little trust, ambiguity in goals and roles, hidden agendas, etc.)
2. ***Storming*** - Inevitable and natural conflict appears. (personality clashes, leadership issues, team roles, etc.)
3. ***Norming*** - The 'unwirtten rules', codes of conduct and acceptable behaviour for the team are developed, shared and agreed.
4. ***Performing*** - Team members are ready to perform the work they have been asigned in a united, cohesive and productive manner.
5. ***Adjourning*** - The project is finished and the team members disband.

## Project lifecycle ( 4 stages of the prject)
1. ***Concept stage (also referred to as initiation, feasibility or stage 1)*** - Idea stage where the project is conceived. Discussion of the preliminary goals, deliveavles & strategic vision alignment, problems raised, impact  assessment in the terms of TBL and lifecycle, potential benefits identifies, alternative approached researched & provisional costing determined
2. ***Planning stage (also referred to as schedule, preparation or stage 2)*** - Following the decision to proceed in stage 1, all work required is planned & scheduled. Objectives are finalized, resources are assigned, quality is signed off on (include TBL and life cycle guidelines & standards), final costs are approved, the timing agreed & all others administrative matters are determined.
3. ***Execution stage, including monitoring & controlling (or implementation, control or stage 3)*** - The project has commenced during this stage & the emphasis is moved to tracking actual progress using the schedules developed in stage 2 as the comparison point of reference. All work is monitored, controlled & corrected where necessary with schedules being reviewed, revised & updated as required.
4. ***Finalization stage (or completion, termination, handover, or stage 4)*** - The project has been completed & the deliverable handed over to the client. Resources are disposed of or reassigned, the project is evaluated, reports are written & presented & the administration arm of the project is closed.

## What are some of the key characteristics of a highly performing project team?
*	Clear, communicated, recognised long-term goals and accepted objectives
*	Mutual appreciation for member’s individual and broad skills
*	Defined, communicated and accepted roles
*	Open, honest and continuous communication
*	Supported leadership 
*	Commitment to delegation and accountability
*	On-going access to constructive feedback and support
*	Appropriate, timely rewards and regular performance reviews

## What scheduling tools are avaliable for project manager and team to plan the project activities?
1. ***Work breakdown structure (WBS)*** is essential as part of a project’s lifecycle and timeline.  
Ad: Captures tasks to complete the project; Identifies tasks relationships; Easy to read in the table format; Makes possible to visualize a complex project; Ties the project together.   
Dis: Time consuming; Potential inconsistency between table & effective schedule; Potential discrepancy between projected & effective resources; Some tasks may be constrained by factors other than predecessors; 
2. ***Program evaluation review technique (PERT)*** or network diagrams is essentially a flowchart of the project tasks  
Ad: Excellent visual & interactive graphic to demonstrate the schedule; Participative decision making; Joint risk identification & response strategy; Negotiated concessions; Improved team ownership; Shows Critical Path; Eliminates idle time   
Dis: Difficult to read if the project is large; No timeline; Difficult to monitor & report performance; Not always easy to understand; Limited amount of information that can display. 
3. ***Critical path analysis (CPA)*** is used to determine what the shortest time to complete the project.  
It offers a visual representation of the project activities, presents the time to complete the tasks and the overall project and tracks of critical activities.
4. ***Gantt chart*** is excellent for tracking progress or activity for tasks once they have been scheduled.  
Ad: Illustrates task duration; Clarifies the 4 task relationship types; Ideal for monitoring actual progress to date; Identifies the critical path/s; Easy to allocate resources; Easy to read from top down & from left to right; Illustrates the application of lead & lag time.  
Dis: Difficult to read due to the amount of information; Time consuming to update & report; Need software to avoid excessive time spent drawing & reviewing schedules; Often bears little resemblance to reality; Easily outdated given the frequency of scope changes & revisions
