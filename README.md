# Project-Management-and-Engineering-Practice

## What are the stages of group development?
1. ***Forming*** - Everyone comes together first time. (little trust, ambiguity in goals and roles, hidden agendas, etc.)
2. ***Storming*** - Inevitable and natural conflict appears. (personality clashes, leadership issues, team roles, etc.)
3. ***Norming*** - The 'unwirtten rules', codes of conduct and acceptable behaviour for the team are developed, shared and agreed.
4. ***Performing*** - Team members are ready to perform the work they have been asigned in a united, cohesive and productive manner.
5. ***Adjourning*** - The project is finished and the team members disband.

## Project lifecycle ( 4 stages of the prject)
1. ***Concept stage (also referred to as initiation, feasibility or stage 1)*** - Idea stage where the project is conceived. Discussion of the preliminary goals, deliveavles & strategic vision alignment, problems raised, impact  assessment in the terms of TBL and lifecycle, potential benefits identifies, alternative approached researched & provisional costing determined
2. ***Planning stage (also referred to as schedule, preparation or stage 2)*** - Following the decision to proceed in stage 1, all work required is planned & scheduled. Objectives are finalized, resources are assigned, quality is signed off on (include TBL and life cycle guidelines & standards), final costs are approved, the timing agreed & all others administrative matters are determined.
3. ***Execution stage, including monitoring & controlling (or implementation, control or stage 3)*** - The project has commenced during this stage & the emphasis is moved to tracking actual progress using the schedules developed in stage 2 as the comparison point of reference. All work is monitored, controlled & corrected where necessary with schedules being reviewed, revised & updated as required.
4. ***Finalization stage (or completion, termination, handover, or stage 4)*** - The project has been completed & the deliverable handed over to the client. Resources are disposed of or reassigned, the project is evaluated, reports are written & presented & the administration arm of the project is closed.
